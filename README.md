Project Overview
For this project, we used a new a data analysis and visualization tool, Tableau.   Tableau is one of the most popular data visualization tools today. It allows data visualization professionals to transform data into an engaging story for any audience. It also help to
create assests that are vitually appealling and easy for a nontechnical audience or stakeholder to understand. We created this visualization to give a chance to stakeholders to be able to easily understand the results and make decisions. 

Tableau help us:

To create powerful analytic dashboard
Tell a clear story
To share ideas easily with stakeholders 
We used tools like worksheets, dashboard and story to create our visualization.

Resources
Software: Jupyter Notebook, Tableau

Module: Pandas

**Analysis**
1) **Checkout Times for Users** We analyze the length of time that bikes are checked out for all riders.

As shown in the image in the above link, most bike riding occur in the first 20 minutes and then experience a downward turn until the first hour and later a constant trend.


2) **Checkout Times by Gender** Most trip durations are for male with a large difference from female as shown in the image in the link below:

3) **Trips by weekday for Each Hour** We graph the number of bike trips by weekday for each hour of the day as shown below:

4) **Trips by Gender (Weekday per Hour)** We graph the number of bike trips by gender for each hour of each day of the week as shown below:

5) **User Trips by Gender by Weekday** We visualize the number of bike trips by gender for each hour for each day of the week as follows:

**Summary**
We used Tableau to create effective visualizations from the Citi Bike data, by starting with a question. But what is the right question to ask and how do we portray the answer accurately?

We had to think critically about which questions are the most important for our analysis. We also had to consider how our audience will perceive and interpret the results and visualization that we show them.

After identifying the what is needed and the data capacity, we performed the visualization:

- Show the length of time that bikes are checked out for all riders and genders.
- Show the number of bike trips for all riders and genders for each hour of each day of the week.
- Show the number of bike trips for each type of user and gender for each day of the week.
